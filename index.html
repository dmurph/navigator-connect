        Security and privacy considerations
      </h2>
      <p>
        Most of what is described here can already be achieved using cross origin iframes, regular
        cross origin messaging, and regular service worker messaging. As such the security and
        privacy implications of this API are minor. Having said that, there are a few parts that
        are a few interesting security and privacy considerations to keep in mind:
      </p>
      <p>
        User agents should not leak any information on sites a user has visited etc to other
        webpages. In particular this means that a service rejecting a connection attempt should be
        indistinguishable from no service being installed to service a particular URL.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        Currently this API only allows connecting to services that have already been installed. If
        in the future some mechanism where attempting to connect to a service can trigger
        installation of a service worker, this of course has its own set of security and privacy
        implications.

      </ol>
      <p class="note">
        Maybe connect should have an additional parameter to connect to pass extra structured data
        to the connection event handler.
      </p>
      <p class="issue">
        Somehow describe that both closing the message port returned by connect and the context
        connect was called in being destroyed result in this webpage being removed from the cross
        origin clients for all service workers.
      </p>
      <p class="issue">
        Using a plain MessagePort does not make it possible for the client to be notified that the
        connection was closed. This might or might not be problematic.

        <p>
          Every cross origin client connected to, or attempting to connect to a service worker, is
          represented by a CrossOriginServiceWorkerClient instance. Clients that are currently
          connected are stored in an internal bookkeeping list of clients associated with each
          Service Worker Registration.

          The <code><dfn id="widl-CrossOriginServiceWorkerClient-targetUrl">targetUrl</dfn></code>

          postMessage</dfn></code> method when invoked calls postMessage on the hidden
          <code><a>MessagePort</a></code> associated with this client. If <code>postMessage</code>
          is called on a client whose connection has not been accepted yet (or when the connection
          has been rejected), postMessage will raise some exception.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whenever a message is targetted at the implicit <code><a>MessagePort</a></code>

          The <code><dfn id=

          to this service worker. Specifically this includes all clients for which an
          oncrossoriginconnect event has been dispatched, and whose connection has been accepted.
          If a client has closed its messageport it will no longer be returned by getAll, and
          similarly when a client is unloaded it will no longer be returned by getAll.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          The getAll method returns the same list of clients for all service workers that are part
          of the same service worker registration, even though connect and message events are only
          dispatched to the active service worker version for a particular registration.
        </p>
        <p class="issue">
          It might be useful to allow filtering on targetUrl in a call to getAll, although that can
          easily enough be added on top of it.

          <li>Run the "Handle Functional Event" algorithm with <var>registration</var> and the

          <li>Fire <var>messageEvent</var> as an event named <code><a>message</a></code>

        <p class="note">
          Note that this means that a message is always delivered to the currently active service
          worker for a given registration, even if the connect event was delivered to a
          different version.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          Also note that this means that a later service worker registration with a narrower scope
          that would have captured the connection attempt had it existed at the time the connection
          was made does not now suddenly get messages for this connection. A
          ServiceWorkerRegistration is associated with a connection at connection time; further
          messages don't try to look up a different service worker registration for the target URL,
          but reuse the same registration.

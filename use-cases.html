        service workers and webpages.

      <p>
        User agents should not leak any information on sites a user has visited etc to other
        webpages, unless the visited site opts in. In particular this means that a service
        rejecting a connection attempt should be indistinguishable from no service being installed
        to service a particular URL.
      </p>
      <p class="issue">
        If attempting to connect to a service can trigger installation of a service worker, we need
        to fill in the security and privacy concerns around doing that.

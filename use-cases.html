        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        This document will use the term <code><dfn>navigator.connect</dfn>()</code> to refer to the
        notional API that allows cross-origin communication between service workers and web pages.
        This isn't intended to presuppose the final shape of the API, although we don't know of any
        alternate proposals.

        <h2>
          Offline Analytics
        </h2>
        <p>
          Third party analytics platforms expose their services via REST interfaces. Thus, these
          platforms are unable to provide insights about offline behavior. As <a>Service
          Worker</a>s and offline web apps become more prevalent, the need for analytics platforms
          that function offline will continue to grow.
        </p>
        <p>
          <code><a>navigator.connect</a></code> enables third party analytics platforms to register
          <a>Service Worker</a>s that expose APIs to track metrics both online and offline. These
          <a>Service Worker</a>s are then able to report these metrics when connectivity is
          reestablished so that they can be consumed by the developer. Furthermore, this reporting
          can be implemented with background sync to take advantage of times when the user’s
          experience will not be impacted—for example, avoiding saturating the network with
          non-essential requests when the user is struggling with poor connectivity or on a heavily
          metered/throttled mobile plan. Thus, exposing analytics APIs via <a>Service Worker</a>s
          allows third party analytics platforms to reduce their performance costs even when
          online.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that without <code><a>navigator.connect</a></code>, a web app frontend could report
          metrics to an analytics platform <a>Service Worker</a> via communication through an
          iframe. However, a web app’s <a>Service Worker</a> would not be able to communicate with
          the analytics platform in this way. Web app <a>Service Worker</a>s perform crucial
          tasks—both online and offline—that are valuable for developers to track.
          <code><a>navigator.connect</a></code> enables the <a>Service Worker</a> to <a>Service
          Worker</a> communication that is necessary for this robust web app analytics model.

        Security and Privacy Considerations
      </h2>
      <p>
        User agents should not leak any information on sites a user has visited etc to other
        webpages, unless the visited site opts in. In particular this means that a service
        rejecting a connection attempt should be indistinguishable from no service being installed
        to service a particular URL.
      </p>
      <p class="issue">
        If attempting to connect to a service can trigger installation of a service worker, we need
        to fill in the security and privacy concerns around doing that.
